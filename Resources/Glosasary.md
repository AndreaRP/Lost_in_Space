- **Volatage (V)**: (Often measured in volts, V) is a measure of electric potential energy per unit charge (per electron). Difference of potential. It represents the difference of potential between two points in a circuit,   which drives the flow of electrons (current) through a conductor. This is like the "height" in the water analogy. It determines the energy **per electron** (or per unit charge).
	
- **Charge (Q):** This is like the "amount of water." It’s the total number of electrons flowing through the circuit. A battery with a higher voltage doesn’t necessarily have more electrons—it just means the electrons have more energy to do work as they move through a circuit.
   - A battery has a voltage because of a chemical reaction inside it that creates a separation of charges. This separation creates a potential difference between the positive and negative terminals. For example, a typical AA battery has a voltage of 1.5V, meaning there’s a potential difference of 1.5 volts between its terminals.
	- If you connect a 9V battery to a circuit, the electrons have more energy (9 joules per coulomb of charge) compared to a 1.5V battery (1.5 joules per coulomb). This means the electrons in the 9V circuit can do more work, such as powering a brighter light bulb or spinning a motor faster.
    
-   **Total Energy (E):** The energy delivered by the electrons is proportional to both the voltage (V) and the total charge (Q)
	- **Drift Velocity (​Vd):** This is the average speed at which electrons move through a conductor in response to an electric field. In a copper wire with a current of 1 A, the drift velocity is about 0.1 mm/s.
	- The kinetic energy of an electron is given by the mass of an electron (9.1×10−31 kg9.1×10−31kg)
and the speed of the electron
	- However, in a circuit, the kinetic energy of electrons isn’t primarily due to their drift velocity. Instead, it’s due to the **electric potential energy** provided by the voltage source.
		- In a **light bulb (incandescent)**, electrons flow through a thin filament, which has high resistance. The collisions between electrons and atoms in the filament cause it to heat up. When the filament gets hot enough, it emits light (and also some heat). In a resistor, electrons collide with atoms in the material, transferring their energy to the atoms. This causes the atoms to vibrate more, which we perceive as heat.
		-  In an **LED** (Light Emitting Diode), electrons recombine with holes in the semiconductor material, when this happens the electrons release their energy in the form of light (in an LED) or other forms of energy.
		-   In an **electric motor**, electrons flow through coils of wire, creating a magnetic field. This magnetic field interacts with other magnets in the motor, causing the coils to rotate.
		- In a **capacitor**, electrons accumulate on one plate, creating an electric field between the plates.
    - To understand electric potential energy, think of it like gravitational potential energy: In a gravitational field, an object gains potential energy as it moves to a higher position. Similarly, in an electric field, an electron gains potential energy as it moves through a voltage difference. For example: A ball at the top of a hill has more gravitational potential energy than a ball at the bottom. An electron in a high-voltage circuit has more electric potential energy than one in a low-voltage circuit.
  - Even though individual electrons move slowly, there are a huge number of free electrons in a conductor. For example, in a copper wire, there are about 8.5×10288.5×1028 free electrons per cubic meter. When the electric field is applied, all these electrons start moving in the same direction, creating a net flow of charge (current).
- **Current (I)**: The flow of electrons is called **current**, measured in **amperes (A)**. When a voltage is applied across a conductor, the electric field exerts a force on the free electrons, causing them to move. Here’s how it works:
	- The electric field pushes the free electrons in one direction (from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the voltage source).	    
	-  As the electrons move, they collide with atoms in the lattice, but they keep being pushed by the electric field.	    
	-  This collective motion of free electrons is what we call **electric current**.
  - The free electrons in a conductor are not bound to specific atoms, so they don’t move through orbitals in the traditional sense. Instead, free electrons exist in a "sea" of delocalized electrons that are shared by all the atoms in the metal lattice.  en a voltage is applied, these free electrons move through the lattice, but they don’t stay associated with any particular atom or orbital
  - The key idea is that current is a collective phenomenon. Even though individual electrons move slowly, the sheer number of free electrons in a conductor means that a large amount of charge can flow through the circuit.
  - If we think of current as water flowing through a pipe:
    - The free electrons are like water molecules.
    - The electric field is like the pressure that pushes the water through the pipe.
    - The current is like the flow rate of the water (how much water passes a point in the pipe per second).
    - Even though individual water molecules move slowly, the collective motion of many molecules creates a flow of water.
- **Amperes (A)**: Electric charge produced (or flowing) in a second. (How much water you can collect in one second). Arduino bords can supply 40mA per pin.
- **Watts (W)**: W = A*V
